**LM Buddy** aims to be an intelligent, interactive desktop assistant, inspired by the helpfulness of classic assistants (Clippy!) but supercharged with local or cloud-based LLMs. Meet **Sherlox** ü¶ä, your primary avatar, ready to analyze your screen, answer your questions, and guide you through your tasks!

This project is a personal journey of learning and exploration into AI, various programming languages, GUIs, and system interaction, driven by curiosity. I'm building this step-by-step and **welcome collaborators and contributors** who are also excited about this kind of technology! Let's learn and build together! üöÄ

## üåü Core Features (current)

*   **üñ•Ô∏è Screen Analysis:** LM Buddy (via Classic GUI) can take a screenshot of your active window.
*   **üîç OCR Integration:** Extracts text from the captured screenshot using Tesseract OCR.
*   **üß† LLM Interaction:**
    *   Sends the captured screen content (text and optionally image) or direct questions to an LLM.
    *   Supports custom LLM endpoints (e.g., local Ollama, LM Studio via OpenAI-compatible API).
    *   Streaming responses for a more interactive experience. (buggy at the moment)
    *   Context history is maintained for coherent conversations. (needs better saving system)
*   **üó£Ô∏è Text-to-Speech (TTS):** LM Buddy can read out LLM responses using `pyttsx3`.
*   **‚å®Ô∏è Global Hotkey Activation:** Trigger screen analysis with a configurable global hotkey (default: `Ctrl+Shift+F`).
*   **üñºÔ∏è Classic UI (Tkinter):**
    *   A Tkinter-based window (`gui.py`) to display conversations, OCR results, and interaction options.
    *   Shows token counts (prompt, completion) for LLM requests (client-side estimation)/(testet and developed for huggingface only).
    *   Configurable settings via a menu (hotkey, system prompt, temperature, OCR language).
*   **ü¶ä Desktop Avatar UI (PySide6 - Work in Progress):**
    *   A frameless, always-on-top window (`avatar_ui.py`) displaying the your favorite avatar.
    *   Avatar can be dragged around the screen.
    *   Automatic direction switching (facing left/right) based on screen position.
    *   Context menu for basic interactions (e.g., closing, switching direction).
    *   Layered component system for avatar body and display element (e.g., blackboard).
    *   Text display on the avatar's "blackboard" with a typewriter effect.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Configuration:** Settings are saved in a `config.json` file.
*   **üß© Modular Core Engine:** A significant portion of the core logic (config, OCR, TTS, LLM handling, hotkey management) has been refactored into an `LMBuddyCoreEngine` located in the `core` package. This promotes maintainability and supports multiple UI skins.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used

*   **üêç Python 3.11+**
*   **GUI Frameworks:**
    *   **Tkinter:** For the classic settings/conversation window.
    *   **PySide6 (Qt for Python):** For the Desktop Avatar UI.
*   **LLM Interaction:**
    *   `requests`: For HTTP API calls to LLM endpoints.
    *   `transformers` (Hugging Face): For client-side tokenization.
*   **Screen Interaction & OCR:**
    *   `Pillow (PIL)`: For image manipulation and screenshots.
    *   `pytesseract`: Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract OCR Engine.
    *   `pygetwindow`: To get active window information.
*   **Input/Output:**
    *   `pyttsx3`: For cross-platform Text-to-Speech.
    *   `keyboard`: For global hotkey listening.
    *   `pyperclip`: For clipboard operations.
*   **UI Enhancements (Tkinter specific):**
    *   `tkhtmlview`: To render HTML/Markdown in the Tkinter GUI.
    *   `markdown2`: For Markdown to HTML conversion.
*   **Development & Packaging (Planned/Potential):**
    *   `PyInstaller` / `cx_Freeze` / `Nuitka`: For creating distributable executables.

## üöÄ Roadmap & Future Ideas (What's Next!)

This project is actively evolving! Here's a glimpse of what's planned or being explored:

*   **ü¶ä Sherlox Avatar Enhancements:**
    *   **[In Progress]** "Show More" functionality for long texts on the avatar's display, adapting to screen resolution and potentially using a scrollable area.
    *   Visual avatar state changes (idle, thinking, typing, listening) with corresponding image assets.
    *   Interactive elements on/around the avatar (e.g., STT button, token display, quick action buttons).
    *   Customizable avatar skins (cat, dog, etc.) and accessories (hats, glasses) - potentially unlockable or selectable.
    *   Different display elements (e.g., computer monitor, futuristic panel).
*   **üó£Ô∏è Speech-to-Text (STT) Integration:** Allow users to dictate questions and commands.
*   **üí° Enhanced Screen Analysis:**
    *   **[Planned]** Screenshot a specific region selected by the user.
    *   Analyze currently selected text system-wide and offer contextual actions (translate, summarize, explain code).
*   **üåê Expanded LLM Provider Support:**
    *   Easy configuration for OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, Anthropic, and other major providers.
    *   Handling for different API key / authentication mechanisms.
    *   Adapting request payloads for provider-specific formats if necessary.
*   **üé® UI/UX Improvements:**
    *   Option to switch between the classic window UI and the Desktop Avatar UI seamlessly.
    *   Refine the look and feel of both UIs.
    *   Consider a Web App interface for broader accessibility (desktop-specific features would require a helper app).
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Core Engine & Stability:**
    *   Further decouple UI from the core engine, potentially using a more formal event bus or message passing system for UI updates.
    *   Robust error handling and logging across all modules.
    *   Performance optimizations.
*   **üåç Internationalization (i18n):** Make the application translatable into multiple languages.
*   **üîß Advanced Configuration:**
    *   More granular control over avatar appearance and behavior via GUI.
    *   GUI for all settings, including hotkey customization for various actions.
*   **üìö Proactive Assistance & Learning:**
    *   LM Buddy could offer proactive tips or follow up on previous topics.
    *   "Gamification" elements like unlocking accessories through usage.
